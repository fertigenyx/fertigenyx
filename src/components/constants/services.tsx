      `IUI (Intrauterine Insemination) is a fertility treatment procedure in which sperm is placed directly inside a woman's uterus to increase the chance of pregnancy. It is a relatively simple and low-invasive procedure, often used in cases of infertility caused by issues with ovulation, sperm count, or cervical mucus. It may be used alone or in combination with other fertility medications such as ovulation induction medications. The success rate of IUI varies depending on the individual patient's circumstances, and it is typically more successful when performed in conjunction with other fertility treatments.`,

      `The innermost lining of the uterus is called the endometrium. The uterus changes its size every month throughout a woman's fertile years. Constant regeneration is the most unique factor of the endometrium. It is the endometrium where the fertilized egg implants itself if the female conceives. A female's body prepares the endometrium to host the embryo as a part of the period cycle each month. The endometrial thickness increases and decreases which is influenced by the hormones estrogen and progesterone and progenitor cell populations and inflammatory mediators. If any of these factors are disturbed, the result will be endometrial disorders with intrauterine scar formation, dysregulated proliferation, and heavy menstrual bleeding.`,
      'Endometrial thickness plays an important role in pregnancy. An endometrium that is neither too thick nor too thin is linked to chances for a healthy, full-term pregnancy. A normal endometrium allows the embryo to implant successfully and gets the correct nutrition it needs. The endometrium gets thicker during the later phase of the pregnancy. The most common cause of infertility is poor endometrial thickness.',
