                  To conceive. IVF or In Vitro Fertilization is one of the more widely known types
                  of Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART). It involves retrieving eggs from the
                  woman&apos;s ovaries and fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory dish. The
                  resulting embryos are then transferred back into the woman&apos;s uterus in the
                  hope of achieving a successful pregnancy.Â 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  IVF treatment in Bangalore is a multi-step process that involves several stages,
